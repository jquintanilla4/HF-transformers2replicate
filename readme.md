# HF Transformers Models to Replicate

This is a template/guide to push a model from Hugging Face to Replicate.

You will need a Linux machine with Nvidia GPU, not an instance on the cloud. Because you need to install docker to push a model to Replicate.
1. Linux machine with Nvidia GPU
2. Docker installed
3. Replicate account
4. Cog installed

Then just follow the steps from the link: https://replicate.com/docs/guides/push-a-transformers-model

**Note**: Be sure to change the predict and cog.yaml to fit your model.
